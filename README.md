Diabetes Prediction App
=======================

This app is built using Flask framework and utilizes the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and naive Bayes algorithms for predicting diabetes in individuals.

Features
--------

-   Input individual's medical information such as blood pressure, insulin levels, and age
-   Predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using KNN and naive Bayes algorithms
-   Displays the results and probabilities of the prediction

Installation
